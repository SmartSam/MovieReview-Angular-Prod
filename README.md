MovieReview-Angular-Prod

This Single Page App created using bunch of technologies. I have used ASP.NET MVC 5 as a base framework. With this I have used Web API, Entity Framework Code First Approach, Unit Of Work pattern, Repository Pattern and design techniques like Single Repository Principle, Factory pattern.... Apart from this I have used Angular framework to write the client side of the application. I have also used libraries like toastr, angular.mock, jasmine and projects like chutzpah to setup my client side testing framework and many more out of the box things.
